# AI-Driven Autonomous vechile and robotics

## ðŸš¦ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Smart City traffic management system using AI and robotics. The goal is to reduce traffic congestion, ensure safety, and improve response times using real-time data from IoT devices, cameras, and drones.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Urban areas face traffic congestion, delayed emergency response, and inefficient signal timings. This system predicts traffic using AI and deploys smart control mechanisms using robotics to manage and optimize city traffic flow.

## ðŸ§  Key Features
- Real-time traffic flow prediction using LSTM / Random Forest
- Smart traffic light control using AI recommendations
- Drone & ground bot-based traffic monitoring
- Secure and privacy-aware system with end-to-end encryption

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
- `src/`: Source code including traffic prediction and robotics control scripts
- `dataset/`: Sample dataset used for model training/testing
- `problem_statement_and_description.pdf`: Project description (Phase 5)
  
## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python, OpenCV
- ROS (Robot Operating System) for drone control
- MQTT / REST APIs for communication
- Arduino/C++ for signal control
- LSTM / Random Forest for traffic prediction

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics
- 25â€“30% simulated reduction in wait time at intersections
- Real-time prediction latency under 2 seconds
- Drone response latency: ~5 seconds

## ðŸ§ª Testing
